# RollerSkate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/m-spilman/RollerSkate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/m-spilman/RollerSkate)

# RollerSkate
This is phase 1 final project

This repo contains a simple build + [Travis CI] setup appropriate for a simple website.

It uses [npm scripts] (located in the `package.json` file under the `"scripts"` key) with
some basic tools like, [StandardJS]

Your application must:

# Use at least one JavaScript library that is not jQuery. 

__Firebase
__Bootstrap
__Materialize


# Access at least two remote APIs using AJAX. 

__Firebase
__Happi.dev



# It should be reachable via a public URL somewhere.
__(https://user-auth24fe0.web.app/index.html)

# Your repo must be connected to Travis CI:
__CHECK!


# You must run at least one test in your Travis CI build (hint: test for StandardJS)
# Put a build status badge in your README.md that links to your latest build

# Code must follow some organization scheme.

# Everything cannot be in one super long file.

# Create one GitHub repo and add all group members as collaborators.

# Collaborate using Pull Requests (PRs):

# No one should commit to the master branch directly.

## "Hey - look at this cool thing I built!"

#### Test System

Tests for [StandardJS] compliance for all files located in `src-js/`. A simple `travis.yml`
file is included to run your tests on [Travis CI].
